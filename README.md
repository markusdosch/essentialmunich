## Transportation

* there exist U-Bahn (covering the city region), S-Bahn (covering a larger area incl. the outskirts), Tram, and Bus.
  * The core section of the S-Bahn is called "Stammstrecke", because all S-Bahn lines go through there: Ostbahnhof, Rosenheimer Platz, Isartor, Marienplatz, Karlsplatz (Stachus), Hauptbahnhof, Hackerbrücke, Donnersbergerbrücke. Official plans count Hirschgarten, Laim, and Pasing also to the Stammstrecke, although not all (but most) lines go through them. While the concept of a "Stammstrecke" is nice for people having to board or get off one of these stations, it has turned into a bottleneck. As there is only one tunnel in each side, if something happens to one line, all lines will be affected and have delays.
* U-Bahn, Tram, and Busses inside Munich is provided by the "MVG". S-Bahn is provided by the DB. Both MVG and DB are member of the "MVV", an association of transportation groups to provide service for Munich and around.
* the monthly ticket is called "IsarCard". It costs 55,20€ for the M-Zone, which covers most of Munich
* the app of choice for calculating the routes is "MVG Fahrinfo" (language can be set to English)
* Airports
  * MUC: reachable via S-Bahn (S1, S8), Lufthansa Airport Bus (also if not traveling with Lufthansa), or car. Discount airline: Easyjet
  * Memmingen has Ryanair, there is an airport bus from Munich
* Car: There is no special fee for owning a car inside the city (different to e.g. London). The only extra cost is parking. Either you have free parking in the streets where you live (less likely in the inner city), your House provided garage spots (around 100€/month), or your get a "Anwohnerparkplatz", which gives you the right to use the park lots near your house.
* Car: When looking at a map of Munich, you can see the "innerer ring", and the "Autobahnring". \
  Car: General driving speed inside the city is 50km/h, outside the city 100km/h, and at the Autobahn unlimited (with a recommended speed of 130km/h). Always except otherwise noted of course.
