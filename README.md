## Transportation
### Public Transport
There exist U-Bahn (covering the city region), S-Bahn (covering a larger area incl. the outskirts), Tram, and Bus. The monthly ticket is called "IsarCard". It costs 55,20€ for the M-Zone, which covers most of Munich. Recommended apps for calculating the routes are "MVG Fahrinfo" and "MVV App". Both apps can be set to English.

The core section of the S-Bahn is called "Stammstrecke", because all S-Bahn lines go through there: Ostbahnhof, Rosenheimer Platz, Isartor, Marienplatz, Karlsplatz (Stachus), Hauptbahnhof, Hackerbrücke, Donnersbergerbrücke. Official plans count Hirschgarten, Laim, and Pasing also to the Stammstrecke, although not all (but most) lines go through them. While the concept of a "Stammstrecke" is nice for people having to board or get off one of these stations, it has turned into a bottleneck. As there is only one tunnel in each side, if something happens to one line, all lines will be affected and have delays.

With MVG Bike, the MVG offers bike sharing services (for use with the "MVG More" app). There are bike stations, but bikes can be rented and returned outside of stations (inside the city radius).

*Background knowledge:* U-Bahn, Tram, and Bus service inside Munich is provided by the "MVG". S-Bahn is provided by the DB. Both MVG and DB are member of the "MVV", an association of transportation groups to provide service for Munich and around.

### Flying
München "Franz Josef Strauß" (shortcode: MUC) is the second-busiest airport in Germany afer Frankfurt, and frequently one of best-rated airports worldwide. It is reachable by S-Bahn (S1, S8) and by car. Lufthansa also offers an airport bus with a return price of 17€. It is available to customers of all airlines, not just Lufthansa. Easyjet is a notable discount airline that flys from and to the airport.

At Memmingen "Munich West" (also: "Allgäu Airport", shortcode: FMM), Ryanair offers cheap flights. There are regular shuttle bus transfers between Munich and Memmingen that take around 1.5h. 

### Car

Different to cities like London, there is no special fee for owning a car inside the city. The only extra cost is parking. Either you have free parking in the streets where you live (less likely in the inner city), your House provided garage spots (around 100€/month), or your apply for a "Anwohnerparkplatz" (very cheap at around 60€/year), which gives you the right to use the park lots near your house.

General driving speed inside the city is 50km/h, outside the city 100km/h, and at the Autobahn unlimited (with a recommended speed of 130km/h). Always except otherwise noted.

Munich's street infrastructure has two major rings. The "Innerer Ring" with a general driving speed of 60km/h, and the "Autobahnring". 

### Other means of transport
The main car sharing providers are DriveNow and Sixt Share. For renting a car, best is probably to compare on CHECK24 or billiger-Mietwagen.de. As for taxis, both Uber and MyTaxi are active in Munich. There are several e-scooter companies competing for market share.

## Living

* Warm rent is usually: Cold rent + utility costs (especially heating and water). Usually, you will pay a monthly lump-sum for the utility costs. At the end of the year, the landlord is required to do a "Nebenkostenrechnung" (calculate the actual exact utility costs for the year). Then, either the renter gets back what was paid too much, or has to pay what was paid too less (then, the future monthly lump-sum should be adjusted)
