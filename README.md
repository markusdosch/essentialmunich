## Transportation
### Public Transport
* There exist U-Bahn (covering the city region), S-Bahn (covering a larger area incl. the outskirts), Tram, and Bus.
  * The core section of the S-Bahn is called "Stammstrecke", because all S-Bahn lines go through there: Ostbahnhof, Rosenheimer Platz, Isartor, Marienplatz, Karlsplatz (Stachus), Hauptbahnhof, Hackerbrücke, Donnersbergerbrücke. Official plans count Hirschgarten, Laim, and Pasing also to the Stammstrecke, although not all (but most) lines go through them. While the concept of a "Stammstrecke" is nice for people having to board or get off one of these stations, it has turned into a bottleneck. As there is only one tunnel in each side, if something happens to one line, all lines will be affected and have delays.
* U-Bahn, Tram, and Bus service inside Munich is provided by the "MVG". S-Bahn is provided by the DB. Both MVG and DB are member of the "MVV", an association of transportation groups to provide service for Munich and around.
* the monthly ticket is called "IsarCard". It costs 55,20€ for the M-Zone, which covers most of Munich
* Recommended app for calculating the routes are "MVG Fahrinfo" and "MVV App". Both apps can be set to English.

* MUC, München "Franz Josef Strauß" is the second busiest airport in Germany afer Frankfurt, and frequently one of highest-rated airports worldwide. It is reachable by S-Bahn (S1, S8) and by car. Lufthansa also offers an airport bus with a return price of 17€. It is available to customers of all airlines, not just Lufthansa. Easyjet is a notable discount airline that flys from and to the airport.
* FMM, Memmingen "Munich West" (also: "Allgäu Airport"). Ryanair offers cheap flights from and to there. There are regular shuttle bus transfers from Munich to Memmingen that take around 1.5h. 

### Car

* There is no special fee for owning a car inside the city (different to e.g. London). The only extra cost is parking. Either you have free parking in the streets where you live (less likely in the inner city), your House provided garage spots (around 100€/month), or your apply for a "Anwohnerparkplatz", which gives you the right to use the park lots near your house.
* When looking at a map of Munich, you can see the "Innerer Ring", and the "Autobahnring". 
* General driving speed inside the city is 50km/h, outside the city 100km/h, and at the Autobahn unlimited (with a recommended speed of 130km/h). Always except otherwise noted.
